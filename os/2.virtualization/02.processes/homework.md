1. Run the program with the following flags: ./process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the -c and -p flags to see if you were right.

```shell
$ /usr/bin/python process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100
Produce a trace of what would happen when you run these processes:
Process 0
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu

Process 1
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu

Important behaviors:
  System will switch when the current process is FINISHED or ISSUES AN IO
  After IOs, the process issuing the IO will run LATER (when it is its turn)

$ /usr/bin/python process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100 -c -p

```

2. Now run with these flags: ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes? Use -c and -p to find out if you were right.

```shell
$ /usr/bin/python process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0
Produce a trace of what would happen when you run these processes:
Process 0
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu

Process 1

  4     RUN:cpu      READY          1

  8        DONE    WAITING                     1
  9        DONE    WAITING                     1
 10*       DONE       DONE

Stats: Total Time 10
Stats: CPU Busy 5 (50.00%)
Stats: IO Busy  4 (40.00%)
```


3. Now switch the order of the processes: ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why? (As always, use -c and -p to see if you were right)

```shell
$ /usr/bin/python process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100
Produce a trace of what would happen when you run these processes:
Process 0
  io

Process 1
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
$ /usr/bin/python process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -p
Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs
  1      RUN:io      READY          1
  2     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1
  3     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1
  4     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1
  5     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1
  6*       DONE       DONE

Stats: Total Time 6
Stats: CPU Busy 5 (83.33%)
Stats: IO Busy  4 (66.67%)
```

4. Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is `-S`, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to SWITCH ON END, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes, one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work? (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`)

```shell
$ /usr/bin/python process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END
Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs
  1      RUN:io      READY          1
  2     WAITING      READY                     1
  3     WAITING      READY                     1
  4     WAITING      READY                     1
  5     WAITING      READY                     1
  6*       DONE    RUN:cpu          1
  7        DONE    RUN:cpu          1
  8        DONE    RUN:cpu          1
  9        DONE    RUN:cpu          1

Stats: Total Time 9
Stats: CPU Busy 5 (55.56%)
Stats: IO Busy  4 (44.44%)
```

5. Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`). What happens now? Use -c and -p to confirm that you are right.

```shell
```

6. One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O com- pletes. With -I IO RUN LATER, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather, what- ever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH ON IO -I IO RUN LATER -c -p) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

7. Nowrunthesameprocesses,butwith-IIORUNIMMEDIATEset, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

8. Now run with some randomly generated processes, e.g., -s 1 -l 3:50,3:50, -s 2 -l 3:50,3:50, -s 3 -l 3:50,3:50. See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use -I IO RUN IMMEDIATE vs. -I IO RUN LATER? What hap- pens when you use -S SWITCH ON IO vs. -S SWITCH ON END?
